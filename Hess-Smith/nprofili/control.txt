%Insert here number of airfoils 
2

%How many points to define each airfoil? (should be an odd number, better like 41,61,81...-> number of panels will be npoints-1) (if not using NACA make sure this matches max number of points among airfoils)
151


%Are you that kind of bad person who wants to change number of panel for each airfoil (No name needed)? (0-> no, 1->yes)
0


%If no, continue you good guy. If yes, shame on you. 
%Specify now number of points for each airfoil (Again, odd number like 41,61,81... -> number of panels will be 40,60,80...). (First -> Main Airfoil, Second -> Flap, (eventually)Third -> Gurney Flap)
